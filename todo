1) Merge ideal gas data into a single class with better polynomial evaluation
2) Look at the 2002 McBryde report and see if it is worth updating some of the species
3) Update the ig test algorithms
4) Add transport/viscosity data to the ig class
5) Add O2, N2, and air multiphase data
6) Transition to the hybrid multiphase inversion algorithm
7) Improve in-line documentation
8) Improve the info() function.. add some kind of searching algorithm
